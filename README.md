# Audio-Matching-Tool
This project enhances audio similarity detection using machine learning and signal processing. By leveraging Python libraries like Librosa and Resemblyzer, it extracts voice embeddings and computes cosine similarity. Advanced techniques like MFCC and chroma features improve accuracy, even with noise variations.
